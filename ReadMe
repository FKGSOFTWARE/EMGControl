Arduino code in src/main.cpp is used to control the board

Currently the python code is using the PyQtGraph Library to live plot the data as well as provide a UI for recording gestures.
Gestures are stored in outputs/gesture recordings that store 5 seconds after a countdown of data from the serial reader. It is then stored in a .csv of a user defined name.
    <!-- ! Note -->
    The name of the gesture must be inputted by the user before the recording is made as it will not save without a filename given.
