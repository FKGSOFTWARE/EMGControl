# Load Cell Calibration Process

Calibrating a load cell is an essential step to ensure accurate weight measurements. Here's a step-by-step guide to calibrate your load cell using the HX711 and Arduino:

## 1. Setup:

- Ensure your load cell and HX711 connections are correct, as per our earlier discussions.
- Make sure your Arduino code has the library included and is correctly set up to read values from the HX711.
- Upload the integrated code (with either baud rate) to your Arduino.

## 2. Open Serial Monitor:

- Open the Serial Monitor in either the Arduino IDE or VSCode/PlatformIO. Ensure the baud rate matches the one set in your code (either 115200 or 57200).

## 3. Zeroing/Tare:

- With no weight on the load cell, press the reset button on your Arduino or power cycle it. This will set the scale to 0.

## 4. Place Known Weight:

- Place a known weight on the load cell. It's best to use a weight close to the maximum capacity of the load cell to get accurate calibration.

## 5. Read Value:

- On the Serial Monitor, note the value displayed for the load cell. This won't be accurate yet, but we'll use it to calculate the calibration factor.

## 6. Calculate Calibration Factor:

- The calibration factor is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Calibration Factor} = \frac{\text{Known Weight}}{\text{Read Value without Calibration}} \]

## 7. Update Code:

- Replace the placeholder calibration factor in the line `scale.set_scale(2280.f);` with the calculated calibration factor.
- Re-upload the code to the Arduino.

## 8. Test Calibration:

- Reset the Arduino or power cycle again to ensure the new calibration factor is in effect.
- Place the same known weight (or even other weights if available) on the load cell and check the Serial Monitor. The displayed weight should now closely match the known weight.

## 9. Fine-Tuning:

- If the displayed value is slightly off, you can fine-tune the calibration factor manually. Adjust it slightly up or down and re-upload the code until the displayed value matches the known weight as closely as possible.

## 10. Finalizing:

- Once you're satisfied with the calibration, note down the calibration factor. You can use this value in the future if you ever need to set up the system again.

**Tips:**
- Ensure the load cell is on a stable and level surface during calibration.
- Calibration is most accurate when the known weight is close to the load cell's maximum capacity.
- Periodically re-check the calibration, especially if the load cell setup is moved or altered.
